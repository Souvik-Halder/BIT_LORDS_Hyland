# BIT_LORDS_Hyland

Basically in this hackathon we are creating a stock prediction website by using the followings

# Project Dependencies

- MERN Stack (For creating the routes for visulaization)
- Flask (For deploying the model on server)
- Pandas, Numpy , Tensorflow , Matplotlib (For creating the ML model)

# Instructions to run the website in Local host

- Download the zip file from  above .
- Open the folder in an IDE (preferenc VS Code)
- Make sure you have node installed in your device
- To run the all python libraries on the root folder run the script `pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn`
- Now run the test.py file to run the flask server by executing the script `python3 test.py`
- In the root run the script `npm i`
- Go to the backend folder and run the script `npm i`
- Go to the frontend folder and run the script `npm i`
- Now go to the backend  folder run `npm start`
- Now go to the fronend folder run `npm start`
- Make sure you have python and pip installed on your device



Now you can see our website running on your default web browser on localhost with port 3000.

You can see the output as per the below images

# Our Future workflow

- We are going to show the all companies graph in a page we are also worked little bit on it
- We also create spearate ML model for 5 more companies like TCS , Infosys ,Samsung , Cognizant, Autodesk
